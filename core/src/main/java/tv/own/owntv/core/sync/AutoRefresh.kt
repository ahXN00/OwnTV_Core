/**
 * The playlist and guide "Auto refresh" settings, for both apps. It used to live in the TV app's
 * shell, so the phone stored the setting and never acted on it.
 *
 * - `includeStartup = true` (cold start): runs once per process, refreshes STARTUP sources
 *   unconditionally and interval sources whose data is at least as old as their threshold. Never
 *   time-throttled, so STARTUP always fires on a real cold start.
 * - `includeStartup = false` (app back in the foreground): skips STARTUP sources and refreshes
 *   interval sources past their threshold. Throttled to once per [RESUME_THROTTLE_MS].
 *
 * Enqueues use [ExistingWorkPolicy.KEEP], so a source already syncing or queued is left alone.
 * Manual re-syncs use REPLACE at their own call sites. A job enqueued here carries
 * [REASON], and the workers hold such a job back while something is playing ([tv.own.owntv.core.live.WatchSession]).
 *
 * A singleton, so the once-per-process rule holds even when the Activity is rebuilt.
