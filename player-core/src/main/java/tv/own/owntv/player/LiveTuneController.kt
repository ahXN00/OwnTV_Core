/**
 * One live channel from "tune" to "playing" or "gave up", for both apps.
 *
 * This is the orchestration the television's `LiveViewModel` and the phone's `LiveTuner` each carried
 * in their own ~600 lines, and which had drifted apart: engine routing ([LiveRouting]), the fallback
 * [LiveLadder] and its "Give up after" alarm, the ExoPlayer ⇄ mpv handover with its decoder-release
 * wait, the Prefer-HLS `.ts` rung, HLS-redirect learning, the Stalker reconnect link and the
 * per-playlist overrides. Each app now keeps only presentation — which channel is on screen, the HUD,
 * history, casting.
 *
 * **Every tune is one job, and a newer one cancels it** ([launch]). Two quick picks can no longer
 * finish in the wrong order, and a catch-up started while a live tune is still resolving is not then
 * overtaken by it.
 *
 * Everything is main-thread: [scope] must be a Main-dispatched scope, as the engines require.
